This lab was tough! It took me couple of days to just get the google sign and youtube to work on my app. 

Google sign in was easy
Youtube:

I followed android Quickstart on YouTube API Integration link in the assignment document.
There are six steps in the Quickstart and I followed all 6 steps. 
I got the YoutubeAndroidPlayerApi.jar from the download link under Get Started.
I copied it into the projects lib directory.
I used code from the textbook - Big Nerd Ranch chapter 25 and 26 to get the Display list and recycler view including fragments.

I have attached screenshots and the apk file in the top directory level. 

I did not do the signed apk, instructions on that were not clear.

Since this is the last lab, please grade with leniency

Thank you
